## Recommended books

The following books are recommended as recommended books for advancing the training curriculum.

-[Ruby on Rails 5 Quick Learning Practice Guide that can be used in the field] (https://book.mynavi.jp/ec/products/detail/id=93905)

The Ruby on Rails 5 Quick Learning Practice Guide that can be used in the field is based on the task management system as well as the training curriculum.
Therefore, I think there are many points that can be helpful in advancing this training.

In addition, the contents that could not be covered in this training and how to proceed with team development are also explained. Please refer to it.

## Topic collection useful for development

The topics that I would like you to take advantage of are summarized in topics.md, although they were not included in the specific issue steps. Please refer to and utilize it as necessary when implementing the curriculum.

## Challenge steps

### Step 1: Build a Rails development environment

#### 1-1: Install Ruby

-Use [rbenv] (https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to install the latest version of Ruby.
--Check that the Ruby version is displayed with the `ruby -v` command

#### 1-2: Rails installation

--Install Rails with Gem command
--Please install the latest version of Rails
--Check that the Rails version is displayed with the `rails -v` command

#### 1-3: Installation of database (PostgreSQL)

--Let's install PostgreSQL on your OS
  --For macOS, please install with `brew` etc.

### Step 2: Create a repository on GitHub

--Install Git at hand
  --For macOS, please install with `brew` etc.
  --Register your username and email address with `gitconfig`
--Let's think about the app name (= repository name)
--Let's create a repository
  --If you don't have an account, get one
  --Let's create an empty repository on it

### Step 3: Create a Rails project

--Create the minimum required directories and files for your application with the `rails new` command
--Create a directory called `docs` directly under the project directory (app name directory) created by` rails new`, and commit this document file.
  ――This is to keep the specifications of this app under control so that you can see them at any time.
--Push the created app to the repository created on GitHub
--In order to specify the version, describe the version of Ruby to be used in `Gemfile` (Make sure that Rails already has the version).

### Step 4: Think about the image of the application you want to create

――Before designing, let's think about the completed image (with supporters) of what kind of application it will be. Screen design by paper prototyping is recommended
  ――Let's think about how this app will be used (whether it will be published on the Internet, for internal use, etc ...) (with supporters).
--Read the system requirements and think about the data structure you need
  ――What kind of model (table) seems to be needed?
  ――What kind of information is needed in the table?
――If you think about the data structure, let's write it by hand on the model diagram.
  ――When completed, take a picture and put it in the repository.
  --Write the table schema in `README.md` (model name, column name, data type)

* It is not necessary to create the correct model diagram at this time. Let's make it as an assumption at the moment (Imagine repairing it if you think it is wrong in the future steps)

### Step 5: Let's set the database connection (peripheral settings)

--First, let's cut a new topic branch with Git
  ――After that, I will work on the topic branch and commit
--Install Bundler
--Install `pg` (PostgreSQL database driver) with` Gemfile`
--Let's set `database.yml`
--Create a database with the `rails db: create` command
--Let's check the connection to the database with the `rails db` command
--Create a PR on GitHub for review
  --Let's issue a PR with WIP (Work In Progress) as needed. Please refer to the topic collection for details.
  --If you have any comments, please respond accordingly. If you have 2 LGTM (Looks Good To Me), merge them into the master branch.

### Step 6: Let's create a task model

Create CRUD to manage tasks.
First, let's make it with a simple structure where only the name and details can be registered.

--Create the model class required for CRUD of tasks with the `rails generate` command
--Create a migration and use it to create a table
  ――It is important to ensure that the migration can be returned to the previous state! Get in the habit of playing `redo` to check
  ――Be sure to set DB restrictions as well.
--Make sure you can connect to the database via the model with the `rails c` command
  --At this time, let's try creating a record with ActiveRecord.
--Let's set validation
  --Let's think about which validation should be added to which column
--Create a PR on GitHub for review

### Step 7: Allow tasks to be viewed / registered / updated / deleted

Let's create a task list screen, detail screen, create screen, edit screen, and delete function.

Creating these features all at once tends to make your PR huge.
Therefore, in step 7, we will proceed with PR by dividing it into multiple parts.

In future steps, if the PR is likely to increase, consider whether you can issue the PR in two or more.

### Step 7-1: Create a task list screen and detail screen

--Let's make it possible to display the task created in step 6 on the list screen and detail screen.
--Create controllers and views with the `rails generate` command
  ――Let's decide which template engine to use in consultation with the supporters.
--Add the required implementations for your controller and view
--Edit `routes.rb` so that the task list screen is displayed at` http: // localhost: 3000 / `
--Let's explain to the supporters what kind of processing is being done between the web browser and the server.
--Create a PR on GitHub for review

### Step 7-2: Let's create a task creation screen and edit screen

--Let's be able to create and edit tasks from the screen
--Let's display a flash message on the screen after creating and updating.
  --If a validation error occurs, display an error message on the screen.
--Create a PR on GitHub for review

### Step 7-3: Let's be able to delete the task

--Let's be able to delete the created task
--Let's display a flash message on the screen after deletion
--Create a PR on GitHub for review

### Step 7-4: Let's look back at the added code

--Let's explain the code added in steps 7-1 to 7-3 to the supporters.
  --About classes, methods and variables
  --About the processing flow

### Step 8: Let's get in touch with SQL

--Let's operate the database
  --Let's connect to the database with the `rails db` command
  --View, create, update and delete tasks in SQL
--Access the task list screen and check that the SQL log is flowing.
  --Let's explain to the supporters what kind of SQL is being executed.
--Let's check what kind of SQL is executed by the method of ActiveRecord
  --Let's run `find`,` where`, etc. with `rails c`

### Step 9: Write a test

--Get ready to write the spec
  --Prepare `spec / spec_helper.rb`,` spec / rails_helper.rb`
--Let's write a model spec for validation
  ――Actually, I don't write much validation test, but let's do it to deepen the understanding of model spec.
--Let's write a system spec for the task function
--Introduce a CI tool such as Circle CI to notify Slack
  ――It doesn't matter if the supporter implements it, considering the difficulty level.
--Reference book: https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec-jp

### Step 10: Let's standardize the Japanese part of the app

--Let's use Rails' i18n mechanism to output validation error messages in Japanese.

### Step 11: Set your Rails timezone

--Set the Rails time zone to Japan (Tokyo)

### Step 12: Sort the task list in order of creation date and time

--Currently, they are sorted in order of ID, but let's sort them in descending order of creation date and time.
--Let's write in the system spec that the sorting is working well

### Step 13: Let's deploy

--Now you have a simple task management system in the master branch, let's deploy it.
--Let's deploy to Heroku
  --If you don't have an account, create one
--Let's touch the deployed app on Heroku
  ――From now on, let's register tasks in this app and proceed with development.
  -* However, Heroku applications can be referenced anywhere on the Internet, so please do not post information that is bad for publication.
    --Basic authentication may be included at this point
  ――From now on, let's continuously deploy your app to Heroku after each step
--Let's describe the deployment method in `README.md`
  ――At that time, it is even better to include the version information of the framework used in this app.

### Step 14: Add an expiration date

--Let's make it possible to register an expiration date for a task
--Let's be able to sort by expiration date on the list screen
--Expand the spec
――If you publicize and get a review, let's release it

### Step 15: Add status to make it searchable

--Let's add status (not started / started / completed)
  -[Option] If you are not a beginner, you may install a Gem that manages the state.
--Let's make it possible to search by title and status on the list screen
  -[Option] If you are not a beginner, you may install a Gem that makes it convenient to implement search such as ransack.
--When narrowing down, let's check the changes in the issued SQL by looking at the log.
  ――Get in the habit of checking as needed in the following steps
--Paste the search index
  --Prepare a certain amount of test data, check the operation while looking at log / development.log, and confirm that adding an index improves the speed.
  -[Option] Let's see the index usage status on the database side using PostgreSQL explain etc.
--Let's add a model spec to the search (let's expand the system spec as well)

### Step 16: Set priorities (* Can be omitted if you have similar implementation experience)

--Let's make it possible to register priorities (high, medium, low) for tasks
--Let's sort by priority
--Let's expand the system spec
――If you publicize and get a review, let's release it (please continue)

### Step 17: Let's add pagination

--Let's add pagination to the list screen using a gem called Kaminari

### Step 18: Guess the design

--Introduce Bootstrap and apply your design to the apps you've created so far
  -[Option] Write and design your own CSS

### Step 19: Make it available to multiple people (user introduction)

--Let's create a user model
--Let's create the first user with seed
--Let's connect users and tasks
  --Let's index the association
  -* When deploying to Heroku, make sure that the already registered task and the user are linked (data maintenance).

### Step 20: Implement login / logout functionality

--Let's implement it yourself without using additional gems
  ――The purpose is to deepen your understanding of the mechanism such as HTTP cookies and Session in Rails by not using Gem such as Devise.
  ――The purpose is also to deepen your understanding of general authentication (such as password handling).
--Let's implement a login screen
--If you are not logged in, make sure that you cannot move to the task management page.
--Let's display only the tasks you created
--Let's implement the logout function

### Step 21: Implement a user management screen

--Let's add a management menu on the screen
--Be sure to add the URL `/ admin` to the beginning of the management screen.
  --Before adding to `routes.rb`, let's design by assuming the URL and routing name (name that becomes` * _path`) in advance.
--Let's implement user list / create / update / delete
--Once you delete a user, try deleting the tasks that the user has.
--Let's display the number of tasks that the user has on the user list screen.
  --Incorporate a mechanism to avoid the N + 1 problem
--Let's see the list of user-created tasks

### Step 22: Let's add a role to the user

--Let's make users distinguish between administrative users and general users
--Let's make the user management screen accessible only to the management user
  --Let's make a special exception when a general user accesses the management screen
  --Catch the exception and display the error page appropriately (you can do it in step 24)
--Let's make it possible to select a role on the user management screen
--Let's control deletion so that no administrative user is lost
  --Let's use the model callback
-* You can use or not use Gem freely.

### Step 23: Let's be able to label tasks

--Let's allow tasks to be labeled multiple times
――Let's make it possible to search by the attached label

### Step 24: Set the error page properly

--Let's make the default error page provided by Rails the screen you created.
--Set the error page appropriately according to the situation
  --Two types of status code settings, page 404 and page 500, are required at least.
